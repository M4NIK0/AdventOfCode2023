# AdventOfCode2023
My [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) attempt of 2023 !

## Infos
I am going to try to do the advent of code of 2023 in Python (3.11), C, C++, C#, Rust (maybe)\
Each day will be in a different folder, and each folder will contain a README.md with the problem, my solution and the input file.\
I am on Manjaro Linux for the whole event, leading (sometimes) to maybe slightly different behaviors of some parts of my code.

## Warnings
Please don't use my code to cheat, it's not the point of the advent of code.\

I post my code on github to share it with you, it can be helpful if you are stuck on a problem, but please don't use it to cheat at any point.

## Thanks
Thanks to [Antoine Jeanson ](https://github.com/antoinejeanson) for the idea of doing the advent (it's my first time!).\

# Here we go!
